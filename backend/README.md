# Flow-Finance
***Under Development***

A personal finance and budgeting web application for the Mrs and I. I was originally developing a desktop application but decided for ease-of-use for us, a web application would be better. In addition the project is an opportunity develop and improve my full-stack web development skills.

This README is currently more a collection of notes for myself rather than anything particularly useful.
